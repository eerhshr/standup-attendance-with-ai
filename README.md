# AI-powered Daily Standup Attendance Summary Agent

This AI agent uses Gemini LLM to automate attendance tracking from team chat converstations. </br>

By intelligently processing chat history, it identifies who is out-of-office, who will attend meetings, and summarizes standup participation. This reduces the manual effort attendance management for remote and hybrid teams, helping teams stay aligned and saving valuable time for project managers and scrum masters.
